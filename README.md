# Hospital Management System (Next.js)

This project is now a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application, migrated from a previous Vite/React codebase.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

- All application code is now in the `next-app/` directory.
- Pages are located in `next-app/app/` using the Next.js App Router.
- Components are in `next-app/components/`.
- Tailwind CSS is fully integrated (see `next-app/app/globals.css`).

## Migration Note

- All Vite and React Router code has been removed.
- If you need to migrate more logic from the old codebase, use the placeholder pages as a starting point.
